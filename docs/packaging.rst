Further Information
-------------------

User Agent
~~~~~~~~~~

When packaging, it's good practise to manually set the user agent used within
the toolkit so that we can get a rough idea of which distros are using this
software.  This is easily done by writing an arbitrary string to
``<root>/ripe/atlas/tools/user-agent``.  Something like this is recommended:::

    RIPE Atlas Tools [FreeBSD 10.2] 1.2

The only limitations to this file are that it should:

* Only have one line in it (all other will be ignored)
* That line should have a maximum of 128 characters in it

If no ``user-agent`` file is included then a platform-specific string will be
automatically generated based on Python's ``platform`` module.
