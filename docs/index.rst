Why This Exists
===============

`RIPE Atlas`_ is a powerful Internet measurements platform that until recently
was only accessible via the website and the RESTful API. The reality however is
that a great many people using RIPE Atlas are most comfortable on the
command-line, so this project is an attempt to fill that gap.
