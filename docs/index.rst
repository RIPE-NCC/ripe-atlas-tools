Why This Exists
===============

[RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net) is a powerful Internet measurements platform that until recently was only accessible via the website and the RESTful API. The reality however is that a great many people
using RIPE Atlas are most comfortable on the command-line, so this project is an
attempt to fill that gap.
