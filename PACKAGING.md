We're working with the community to get this project packaged for as many
platforms as possible.  To that end, We've created this file to help organise
resources.

If you'd like to package the toolkit for your favourite distro, or if you've
already started, please add your name/GitHub below with a pull request so we
don't have people wasting time doubling up on work rather than collaborating.

## Voidlinux

* [jnbr](https://github.com/jnbr)

## Windows

* [Chris Amin](https://github.com/chrisamin)

### Status

A highly experimental self-contained installer is available at https://github.com/chrisamin/ripe-atlas-tools-win32/. This installer doesn't require the presence of a system Python installation.

## Other Platforms

We've been talking with members of the community about expanding the package
support for Magellan, but so far no one has officially volunteered. The RIPE
Atlas team is happy to assist anyone interested in porting this toolkit to any
platform, but we're especially keen on at least getting into:

* Red Hat
* CentOS

free to add your name here or contact us directly via *atlas at ripe dot net*.
